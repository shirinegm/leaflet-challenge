# leaflet-challenge
Demo for a Leaflet Map that plots earthquakes on a mapbox map using data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. The specifc dataset is pulled from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson which corresponds to all earthquakes in the last 7 days. The dataset is updated every minute.
